# Delaware School Finance

[(School finance) Financial Transparency Links](https://www.doe.k12.de.us/domain/558). Includes the [Educational Statistics Report](https://www.doe.k12.de.us/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=11358&dataid=24493&FileName=Fiscal%20district%20financial%20report%20REGULAR%20SCHOOL_V3.pdf) with state and local funding. ["Education Budget"](https://www.doe.k12.de.us/Page/3509) includes the Equalization Committee's [report](https://www.doe.k12.de.us/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=9243&dataid=24259&FileName=FY21%20Equalization%20Report.pdf) with some background, as well as the [Assessment and Tax Rate Table](https://www.doe.k12.de.us/site/handlers/filedownload.ashx?moduleinstanceid=9243&dataid=22718&FileName=FY20%20Assessment%20and%20Tax%20Rate%20Table.pdf), which looks like the data on assessed vs. "full" evaluation.

DE's [Open Data Portal (Socrata)](https://data.delaware.gov/) has enrollments, but not school finance.

I need FY20 state and local funding per school district, because I have FY20 assessments.

The [Opportunity Funding page](https://governor.delaware.gov/district-charter-spending/) has an [overview of OF received by each district](https://governor.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2020/02/Opportunity-Funding_contracttotals.pdf) in presumably 2019-20.
